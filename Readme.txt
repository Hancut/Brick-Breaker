~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         Brick Breaker       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  


	Is a one player game. Rules are simple: you need to 
destroy the bricks and the ball must not fall of the platform.
You have 3 lifes and 2 powerups: thunder that offer speed and 
mushroom that makes the ball bigger. The powersups are hidden
in the back of some random bricks. You can "eat" maximum 3 mushrooms,
and the power is on for 10 seconds. The power of thunder is on, just like
mushrooms, for 10 seconds, and if in that time you catch another thunder,
the time is reset.
	Controls: 
	- the ball is powered by the left click (in begining 
of the game or after you lost a life)
	- platform is moving after the mouse cursor
